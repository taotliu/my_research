### Selective gold standard testing 

The World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for monitoring the effectiveness of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment in resource-limited settings are mostly based on clinical and immunological markers (e.g., CD4 cell counts). Recent research indicates that the guidelines are inadequate and can result in high error rates. Viral load (VL) is considered the “gold standard,” yet its widespread use is limited by cost and infrastructure. In this article, we propose a diagnostic algorithm that uses information from routinely collected clinical and immunological markers to guide a selective use of VL testing for diagnosing HIV treatment failure, under the assumption that VL testing is available only at a certain portion of patient visits. Our algorithm identifies the patient subpopulation, such that the use of limited VL testing on them minimizes a predefined risk (e.g., misdiagnosis error rate). Diagnostic properties of our proposed algorithm are assessed by simulations. For illustration, data from the Miriam Hospital Immunology Clinic (Providence, RI) are analyzed. [more](assets)

### Local sensitivity to nonignorable data coarsening

Untestable assumptions about the association between survival and censoring times can affect the validity of estimates of the survival distribution including the Kaplan–Meier (KM) nonparametric maximum like- lihood estimate (MLE). This paper explores the sensitivity of the KM curve to nonignorable censoring by extending the index of local sensitivity to nonignorability (ISNI; Troxel et al., Statistica Sinica, 14, 1221–1237, 2004; Zhang and Heitjan, Biometrics, 62, 1260–1268, 2006) to the case of a nonparametric survival model. The method involves, first, specifying a coarse-data selection model to describe the association between the fail- ure and censoring processes and then evaluating the slope of the nonparametric survival MLE ordinate with respect to a nonignorability parameter in the neighborhood of the ignorable model. We define the nonparamet- ric MLE of the survival curve for a fixed value of the nonignorability parameter and show in a simulation that ISNI analysis effectively captures local sensitivity to nonignorability. The method measures sensitivity in the sense of identifying functionals of the nonparametric MLE that nonignorability, if present, can affect substantially. We demonstrate the method with an application to a trial comparing mechanical assistance to optimal medical management in the treatment of end-stage heart failure. ...[more](foo)

### Estimating ATE and unmeasured confounding

Confounding is a major concern when using data from observational studies to make causal inference. Instrumental variables (IVs) can be used to construct bound estimates on causal treatment effects when outcomes are binary, even with presence of unmeasured con- founding. With continuous outcomes, meaningful bounds are more difficult to obtain because the domain of the outcome is typically unrestricted. In this paper, we propose to combine the instrumental variable and inverse probability weighting (IPW) methods, together with subjec- tive assumptions in the context of an observational cohort study of HIV-infected women, to construct meaningful bounds on the initial-stage causal effect of antiretroviral therapy on CD4 cell count. The subjective assumptions are encoded in terms of the potential outcomes that are partially identified by data. The IPW method further incorporates a sensitivity parameter to capture the effect of unmeasured confounding. Instead of conducting a sensitivity analysis, we unify the IV and IPW methods using the principal stratification, which leads to a system of estimating equations. By solving the equations, we simultaneously quantify both the causal treatment effect as well as the degree of the unmeasured confounding. We demonstrate the method by analyzing data from the HIV cohort Study. ...[more](foo)


### Enrichment study design 

Randomized discontinuation trial (RDT) has gained popularity across a number of ther- apeutic areas. Oncology is one of the most known. In the simplest case, at the initial open-label stage all patients are treated with the experimental treatment to identify a population of responders. This stage is followed by a randomized two-arm trial to com- pare two conditions, for example, treatment versus placebo. Potentially RDT increases the efficiency of trials relatively to traditional designs gaining information from a sen- sitized population if the open-label stage provides a reliable separation of responders from nonresponders. Often a sensitized population is called an enriched population, and respectively, the RDT is called “enrichment experiment.” We compare RDT with the traditional two-arm randomized clinical trials (RCT) for binary outcomes assuming that the population of interest consists of three groups: placebo responders, treatment-only responders, and nonresponders. Our results are derived in the “parameter estimation” setting and they are based on the comparison of estimator variances. We identify con- ditions under which RDT is either superior or inferior to RCT in terms of response rates, misclassification rates, and clinical ethics. Extension of our results to design optimization, hypothesis testing, and sample size calculation is rather straightforward. ...[more](foo)
