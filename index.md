### Selective gold standard testing 

The World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for monitoring the effectiveness of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment in resource-limited settings are mostly based on clinical and immunological markers (e.g., CD4 cell counts). Recent research indicates that the guidelines are inadequate and can result in high error rates. Viral load (VL) is considered the “gold standard,” yet its widespread use is limited by cost and infrastructure. In this article, we propose a diagnostic algorithm that uses information from routinely collected clinical and immunological markers to guide a selective use of VL testing for diagnosing HIV treatment failure, under the assumption that VL testing is available only at a certain portion of patient visits. Our algorithm identifies the patient subpopulation, such that the use of limited VL testing on them minimizes a predefined risk (e.g., misdiagnosis error rate). Diagnostic properties of our proposed algorithm are assessed by simulations. For illustration, data from the Miriam Hospital Immunology Clinic (Providence, RI) are analyzed. [more](assets)

### Local sensitivity to nonignorable data coarsening

Untestable assumptions about the association between survival and censoring times can affect the validity of estimates of the survival distribution including the Kaplan–Meier (KM) nonparametric maximum like- lihood estimate (MLE). This paper explores the sensitivity of the KM curve to nonignorable censoring by extending the index of local sensitivity to nonignorability (ISNI; Troxel et al., Statistica Sinica, 14, 1221–1237, 2004; Zhang and Heitjan, Biometrics, 62, 1260–1268, 2006) to the case of a nonparametric survival model. The method involves, first, specifying a coarse-data selection model to describe the association between the fail- ure and censoring processes and then evaluating the slope of the nonparametric survival MLE ordinate with respect to a nonignorability parameter in the neighborhood of the ignorable model. We define the nonparamet- ric MLE of the survival curve for a fixed value of the nonignorability parameter and show in a simulation that ISNI analysis effectively captures local sensitivity to nonignorability. The method measures sensitivity in the sense of identifying functionals of the nonparametric MLE that nonignorability, if present, can affect substantially. We demonstrate the method with an application to a trial comparing mechanical assistance to optimal medical management in the treatment of end-stage heart failure.
